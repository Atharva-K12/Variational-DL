# Variational-DL

#### Variational Deep Learning is a method of deep learning where we use Neural Networks to generate data, instead of drawing conclusions from it.

#### We have currrently implemented two Autoencoders:
* [Vanilla Autoencoder](vanilla/README.md) on MNIST dataset.
* [Denoising Autoencoder](denoise/README.md) on MNIST dataset.
